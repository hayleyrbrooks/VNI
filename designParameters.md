# Design parameters for VNI study

#### Goals:
  1. Capture a variety of possible risk-taking behavior (very risk averse to very risk-seeking).
  2. Create context, keep it the same for a bit, then change it (with the least moving parts (confounds) possible).

## Choice set features
- Possible risky gain values $0 - $60
- Possible loss values $0 
- Possible safe values $0 - $30
- 219 trials 
- 5 discrete levels, or mean expected values: {5,10,15,20,25}
- Noise on each trial is +/-.50 from the mean expected value
- Variance at each level is identical
- 42 trials at each level of context
- 4 runs of trials {6,9,12,15 trials} at each context, 5 runs for the starting context to capture a shift *back* to that level
- 21 total shifts
-   Small (level 1 to level 2) to large (level 1 to level 5) shifts to-and-from each run
- Two types of attention check trials
    1. risky gain is very large ( > $50) and safe option is $0 (participants should accept the gamble)
    2. safe option is >= risky gain amount (participants should reject the gamble)

Average trial time is 8.5s (triple check this - we may have changed is slightly because of CINC's time constraint)
