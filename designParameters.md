# Design parameters for VNI risky decision-making task

#### Goals:
  1. Capture a variety of possible risk-taking behavior (very risk averse to very risk-seeking).
  2. Create context, keep it the same for a bit, then change it (with the least moving parts (confounds) possible).



## Choice set features
- Participants chose between a gamble (50/50 chance of a win ($+) and loss ($0)) and a smaller, guaranteed alternative, or a safe option (+$)
- Possible risky gain values $0 - $60
- Possible loss values $0 
- Possible safe values $0 - $30
- 219 trials 

### Context
- Five discrete levels of context defined by mean expected values
  - mean expcted value is defined as ((risky gain x probability + risky loss x probability) + (safe x probability))/2
    - e.g. (($60 x .5 + $0 x .5) + ($20 x 1))/2 = 25
  - levels, or  mean expected values: 5,10,15,20,25
  - On each trial, the mean expected value is +/- .50 from the mean expected value of the context (to create some noise)
  - Variance at each level is identical
- Context was set up in the task by 4 "runs" of trials at each level
  - Runs contained 6,9,12,15 trials  
  - The starting context consited of a fifth run with 9 trials to ensure a shift *back* to that level
  - 42 trials at each level of context with the exception of 51 trials at the starting context
    - This number was in part determined by time constraints (i.e. how many trials we could fit in the task) 
    - Along each context, most trials were sampled from a combination of risky gain and safe combinations that were close to indifference (follow-up on this)
- Context changed following a shift up or down to the next context
  - 20 total shifts to ensure that for each level of context, there was a shift to-and-from the other contexts
- All participants experienced the same shifts and run sizes but the order was random
- Two types of attention check trials
    1. risky gain is very large ( > $50) and safe option is $0 (participants should accept the gamble)
      - there are 0 to 4 of these trials (0 for 3 participants because of coding error that was fixed after the 10th participant)
      - most participants had 2-3
    3. safe option is >= risky gain amount (participants should reject the gamble)
      - there are 12 to 17 trials (most participants had 14)

Average trial time is 8.5s (triple check this - we may have changed is slightly because of CINC's time constraint)
