##### Tips from template:
1) Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 
2) Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
3) When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 
4) The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

***
##### Set up
```{r}
rm(list=ls());  # clear environment


library(config);
config <- config::get();

vni_csv = file.path(config$path$data$clean,config$csvs$RDM_group_clean_csv);
mriBehClean = read.csv(vni_csv);


library(lme4);
library(lmerTest);
```

***
##### Subject information
```{r}
subIDs = unique(mriBehClean$subjectIndex);
nSub = length(subIDs);
sprintf("N = %s", nSub)
```

### Big Question
#### Does risk-taking change as a function of temporal context at three levels?
1) Immediate (past outcome) 
2) Neighborhood (shifts) 
3) Global (earnings)


***

### Trial-level model
##### Summary: Participants more likely to choose an option as its amount increases (no effect of ground expected value)
```{r}
model1_trialLevel = glmer(choice~ 0 + gainSC + altSC + grndEVscaled + (0+ gainSC + altSC|subjectIndex), data = mriBehClean, family = "binomial"); # model identical to VIC

summary(model1_trialLevel);

```

***
#####  Pull out "predicted" values from trial-level model and save as variable "pred" in mriBehClean dataframe
**Using "offset", they'll be applied inside the softmax with a weight of 1 every time, in effect accounting for our best current-trial predictions by directly entering those predictions on a trial-by-trial level. This lets us retain the binomial analysis structure vs using residuals ("resids"), which is much more accurate.**

```{r}
mriBehClean$pred= predict(model1_trialLevel,type="link"); 
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(mriBehClean$pred, ylab="predicted values");

```

***
#### 1) Immediate timescale: past outcome  
##### Summary: There is a negative interaction between past outcome type and amount (plotted below) where risk-taking increases following a large loss (missed gain) and decreases following a large gain.
```{r}
model2_potc_amt = glmer(choice ~ 0 + poc1scaled + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model2_potc_amt);  # ns; AIC = 7592.9

# LEFT OFF HERE 6/15- HRB CONFUSED ABOUT BEST WAY TO PLOT THIS

lossPgam = 1/(1+exp(-1*( (typeCoef*-1) + (amtCoef*lossOutcomes) + (intxnCoef*-1*lossOutcomes) )));

LEFT OFF HERE!! 6/14 - CREATED THE RECEIVED-NOT, UPDATED THE MODELS AND NOW NEED TO CHANGE THE PLOT

#### 2) Neighborhood timescale: Shifts 
##### Summary: Risk-taking increases following a positive shift only and the effect is short-lasting (similar to VIC). Shift does not interact with run size or past outcome.
```{r}
model3_signed_shifts = glmer(choice~0 + shiftDiffsc + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);

summary(model3_pos_neg_shifts); # both positive and negative shift difference, only positive significant
m3_coef_posShift = fixef(model3_pos_neg_shifts)[1];

## Plot the effect of positive shift
# scaled shift amounts = 0 to .33 (or 0 to 20 nonscaled)
PgamPosShiftZero = 1/(1+exp(-1*( (m3_coef_posShift*0) ))); # should be .5
PgamPosShiftLarge = 1/(1+exp(-1*( (m3_coef_posShift*.33) )));
# probability of gambling following large positive shift = 0.6518448, a %15.2 increase
PgamPosShiftMedium = 1/(1+exp(-1*( (m3_coef_posShift*.16) )));

axis(1, labels=c("no shift", "medium", "large"), at=c(1,2,3))
axis(2)



```

#### How far back does shift effect go?
```{r}
# create new positive shift variable (n-1)
newMat = matrix(data=NA,nrow=nrow(mriBehClean), ncol=2);
newMat[,1] <- mriBehClean$shiftDiffscPOS; #take data from columns
newMat[2:nrow(newMat),1] <- newMat[1:(nrow(newMat)-1),1]; # removes first row, shifts everything up
newMat[1,1] <- NaN #put Nan in for first row (first trial for subject 1, bc there is no past trial)
newMat[,2]<-c(0,diff(mriBehClean$subjectIndex)); #put differences between subjectIndex into newvector, 1s show up when subject changes
newMat[newMat[,2]==1,]=NaN; #in newmtx, when diff = 1, replace with NaN, this replaces first trial with nan
mriBehClean$shiftDiffscPOS1 = newMat[,1];# add new vector to mriBehClean

# do the regressions
model3_pos_shift_howfarback = glmer(choice ~ 0 + shiftDiffscPOS + shiftDiffscPOS1 + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model3_pos_shift_howfarback); #short lasting, only trial directly after a shift

```


#### Does positive shift interact with previous run size or past outcome?
```{r}

# positive shift amount and run size before positive shift
model3_shift_pos_runSize = glmer(choice ~ 0 + shiftDiffscPOS*runSizePOS +(1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model3_shift_pos_runSize); # all betas ns


# both positive and negative shift and run size before positive and negative shift
model3_shift_pos_neg_runSize = glmer(choice ~ 0 + shiftDiffscPOS*runSizePOS + shiftDiffscNEG*runSizeNEG + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);

# Does positive shift interact with past outcome?

summary(model3_posShift_potc_intxn); #all betas ns


```

#### 3) Global timescale: Cumulative earnings (and trial) 
##### Summary: Cumulative earnings are more tied to trial than previous datasets, even VIC. Earnings and trial have opposite effects with risk-taking increasing with earnings and decreasing across the task. Similar to VIC and CBM, earnings interacts with past outcome (trial DOES NOT). P

# PSH IDEA ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH TRIAL AND EARNINGS: this figure below is technically showing the difference between earnings and trial because they have opposite effects 
# are these effects capturing the overall difference between actual earnings and expected earnings (which would be captured by linear regressor like trial)
# as if people are adjusting risk taking depending on how they are doing compared to how they EXPECT to be doing
# if so, this figure seems to show that:
# points above .5: when doing better than expected earnings, more risk-seeking 
# points below .5: when doing worse than expected earnings, less risk-seeking
# HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS WITH THE INTERACTION BETWEEN EARNINGS AND OUTCOME?


# Model and plot with interaction term between earnings and trials

### Each timescale in a single model:
#### Summary: Similar effects that we have noted prior: negative past outcome effect that interacts with cumulative earnings and positive shift effect. Note - did not account for outcome type in this model.
```{r}

##### Plot earnings x outcome effect using the model above (the interaction term is much smaller than in m4_earning_potc_intxn model), so we'd expect the switching of the past outcome effect to be less intense:
