##### Set up
```{r}
rm(list=ls());  # clear environment


library(config);
config <- config::get();

vni_csv = file.path(config$path$data$clean,config$csvs$RDM_group_clean_csv);
mriBehClean = read.csv(vni_csv);


library(lme4);
library(lmerTest);
```

***
##### Subject information
```{r}
subIDs = unique(mriBehClean$subjectIndex);
nSub = length(subIDs);
sprintf("N = %s", nSub)
```

### Big Question
#### Does risk-taking change as a function of temporal context at three levels?
1) Immediate (past outcome) 
2) Neighborhood (shifts) 
3) Global (earnings)


***

### Trial-level model
##### Summary: Participants more likely to choose an option as its amount increases (no effect of ground expected value)
```{r}
model1_trialLevel = glmer(choice~ 0 + gainSC + altSC + grndEVscaled + (0+ gainSC + altSC|subjectIndex), data = mriBehClean, family = "binomial"); # model identical to VIC

summary(model1_trialLevel);

```

***
#####  Pull out "predicted" values from trial-level model and save as variable "pred" in mriBehClean dataframe
**Using "offset", they'll be applied inside the softmax with a weight of 1 every time, in effect accounting for our best current-trial predictions by directly entering those predictions on a trial-by-trial level. This lets us retain the binomial analysis structure vs using residuals ("resids"), which is much more accurate.**

```{r}
mriBehClean$pred= predict(model1_trialLevel,type="link"); 
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
#plot(mriBehClean$pred, ylab="predicted values");

```

***
#### 1) Immediate timescale: past outcome  
##### Past outcome amount and type: past outcome and type alone in models both not significant. In a model with past outcome type, type is significant (beta = .12(.06), p=.03) and interacts with outcome amount (beta = -.54(.2), p=.005). The model with the interaction performs better by AIC comparison.
```{r}
model2_potc_amt = glmer(choice ~ 0 + poc1scaled + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model2_potc_amt);  # ns; AIC = 7592.9 

model2_potc_type = glmer(choice ~ 0 + poc1type + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model2_potc_type); # ns; AIC =7592.1 

model2_potc_amt_type_intxn = glmer(choice ~ 0 + poc1type*poc1scaled + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model2_potc_amt_type_intxn); # negative interaction between outcome type and amount; AIC = 7588.0

```

**Plot the interaction between past outcome amount and type:**  
**Outcome type is coded: 0 = safe; 1 = risky gain; -1 = risky loss (always $0)**
```{r}

m2coef = fixef(model2_potc_amt_type_intxn); # store all beta estimates

typeCoef = m2coef[1]; # past outcome type coefficient
amtCoef = m2coef[2]; # past outcome amount coefficient
intxnCoef = m2coef[3]; # past outcome type and amount interaction coefficient

## SAFE OUTCOMES
# Largest outcome when a participant rejected gamble = 30.49, scaled = .499918
# smallest outcome when a participant rejected gamble  = .78, scaled = .01278898
PgamPOCsafeSmall = 1/(1+exp(-1*( (typeCoef*0) + (amtCoef*.499918) + (intxnCoef*0*.499918) ))); 
# probability of gambling following a small, safe past outcome  = 0.5275424, 2.7% increase

PgamPOCsafeLarge = 1/(1+exp(-1*( (typeCoef*0) + (amtCoef*.01278898) + (intxnCoef*0*.01278898) ))); 
# probability of gambling following a large, safe past outcome  = 0.5007053 

## GAINS
# largest outcome when a participant accepted gamble and won = $60.99, scaled = 1
# smallest outcome when a participant accepted gamble and won = $5.31, scaled = 0.08706345
  # technically, the minimum it could be 0 if participants missed an attn check
# medium outcome = $30.5, scaled = .5
# outcome when a participant accepted gamble and lost = $0

PgamPOCwinLarge = 1/(1+exp(-1*( (typeCoef*1) + (amtCoef*1) + (intxnCoef*1*1) ))); 
# probability of gambling following a large, risky win = 0.4511035, 5% decrease 
PgamPOCwinSmall = 1/(1+exp(-1*( (typeCoef*1) + (amtCoef*0.08706345) + (intxnCoef*1*0.08706345) ))); 
# probability of gambling following a small, risky win = 0.5237715, a 2% increase
PgamPOCwinMedium = 1/(1+exp(-1*( (typeCoef*1) + (amtCoef*.5) + (intxnCoef*1*.5) ))); 
# probability of gambling following a medium, risky win = 0.4908425, a slight (<1%) decrease


## LOSSES (always zero)
PgamPOClossZero = 1/(1+exp(-1*( (typeCoef*-1) + (amtCoef*0) + (intxnCoef*-1*0) ))); 
# probability of gambling following a loss = 0.4693025, a 4.5% decrease


plot(c(PgamPOCwinSmall, PgamPOCwinMedium, PgamPOCwinLarge), type="l", col="green", lwd=3, ylim=c(0,1), main="Risk-taking as a function of past outcome type and amount", ylab="p(gamble)", xlab="past outcome", axes=F)

lines(c(PgamPOCsafeSmall,PgamPOCsafeLarge), col="blue", lwd=3)
points(c(PgamPOClossZero), pch=16, col="red", lwd= 3)



```

It looks like there is a very slight difference between loss and gain/safe outcome. Do people treat losses like a missed gain? No, doesn't look like that is happening here.
```{r}
# Missed gain variable - positive value for losses (its the previous risky gain amount). Note that this is the missed gain on the previous trial.

summary(model2_potc_missedGain_type_intxn); #AIC = 7594.1, nothing is significant

# Another way to look at this would be a regressor that is received - not received (so it is one continuous regressor that includes losses(missed gains), wins, and safes on the previous trial). Don't need to include type here.
model2_potc_receivedDiff_type_intxn = glmer(choice ~ 0 + pocRcvdMinusNotSC + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model2_potc_receivedDiff_type_intxn); #AIC = 7589.2. ns

```

#### 2) Neighborhood timescale: Shifts 
##### Summary: Risk-taking increases following a positive shift only and the effect is short-lasting (similar to VIC). Shift does not interact with run size or past outcome.
```{r}
model3_signed_shifts = glmer(choice~0 + shiftDiffsc + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model3_signed_shifts); # signed shift difference, significant

model3_pos_neg_shifts = glmer(choice ~ 0 + shiftDiffscPOS + shiftDiffscNEG + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model3_pos_neg_shifts); # both positive and negative shift difference, only positive significant
m3_coef_posShift = fixef(model3_pos_neg_shifts)[1];

## Plot the effect of positive shift
# scaled shift amounts = 0 to .33 (or 0 to 20 nonscaled)
PgamPosShiftZero = 1/(1+exp(-1*( (m3_coef_posShift*0) ))); # should be .5
PgamPosShiftLarge = 1/(1+exp(-1*( (m3_coef_posShift*.33) )));
# probability of gambling following large positive shift = 0.6518448, a %15.2 increase
PgamPosShiftMedium = 1/(1+exp(-1*( (m3_coef_posShift*.16) )));
# probability of gambling following medium positive shift = 0.5754388, a %7.5 increase


plot(c(PgamPosShiftZero, PgamPosShiftMedium,PgamPosShiftLarge), type="l", lwd=3, col="blue", axes=F, ylab="p(gamble)", xlab="positive shift", main="risk taking as a function of positive shift")
axis(1, labels=c("no shift", "medium", "large"), at=c(1,2,3))
axis(2)



```

#### How far back does shift effect go?
```{r}
# create new positive shift variable (n-1)
newMat = matrix(data=NA,nrow=nrow(mriBehClean), ncol=2);
newMat[,1] <- mriBehClean$shiftDiffscPOS; #take data from columns
newMat[2:nrow(newMat),1] <- newMat[1:(nrow(newMat)-1),1]; # removes first row, shifts everything up
newMat[1,1] <- NaN #put Nan in for first row (first trial for subject 1, bc there is no past trial)
newMat[,2]<-c(0,diff(mriBehClean$subjectIndex)); #put differences between subjectIndex into newvector, 1s show up when subject changes
newMat[newMat[,2]==1,]=NaN; #in newmtx, when diff = 1, replace with NaN, this replaces first trial with nan
mriBehClean$shiftDiffscPOS1 = newMat[,1];# add new vector to mriBehClean

# do the regressions
model3_pos_shift_howfarback = glmer(choice ~ 0 + shiftDiffscPOS + shiftDiffscPOS1 + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model3_pos_shift_howfarback); #short lasting, only trial directly after a shift

```


#### Does positive shift interact with previous run size or past outcome?
```{r}

# positive shift amount and run size before positive shift
model3_shift_pos_runSize = glmer(choice ~ 0 + shiftDiffscPOS*runSizePOS +(1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model3_shift_pos_runSize); # all betas ns


# both positive and negative shift and run size before positive and negative shift
model3_shift_pos_neg_runSize = glmer(choice ~ 0 + shiftDiffscPOS*runSizePOS + shiftDiffscNEG*runSizeNEG + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model3_shift_pos_neg_runSize); #all betas ns



# Does positive shift interact with past outcome?
model3_posShift_potc_intxn = glmer(choice ~ 0 + shiftDiffscPOS*poc1scaled + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model3_posShift_potc_intxn); #all betas ns


```

***
#### 3) Global timescale: Cumulative earnings (and trial) 
##### Summary: Cumulative earnings are more tied to trial than previous datasets, even VIC. Earnings and trial have opposite effects with risk-taking increasing with earnings and decreasing across the task. There is a trending interaction between trial and earnings (p=.06). AIC is better in model that includes both terms and an interaction between them.
```{r}

# First looking at earnings and trial in a model (no past outcome, shift variable)
model4_earnings_trial = glmer(choice~0 + earningsNormalized + trialSC + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);

for(s in 2:nSub){
  points(mriBehClean$earnings[mriBehClean$subjectIndex==s], type="l", lwd = 1, col = mriBehClean$subjectIndex/.2+s)
};
```



##### Do earnings interact with outcome? 
```{r}
# Earnings interact with past outcome in previous datasets, does that happen here?
model4_earnings_potc_intxn = glmer(choice~0 + earningsNormalized*poc1scaled + trialSC*poc1scaled + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
summary(model4_earnings_potc_intxn); # AIC = 7560.0 
# past outcome negative effect
# interaction between outcomes and earnings are significant. 
# interaction between outcomes and trial are trending at p=.09 
# Main effects of earnings and trial go away (consistent with previous datasets, eg. VIC). 

# shift is not in this model, but when we do add shift, there is a similar pattern in behavior, interaction between outcome and trial is a little weaker (p=.1) and trial and earnings not significant.Strong effect of positive shift AIC =  7552.4 - including shift improves model fit.
#model4_earnings_potc_intxn_shift = glmer(choice~0 + earningsNormalized*poc1scaled + trialSC*poc1scaled + shiftDiffscPOS + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred);
#summary(model4_earnings_potc_intxn_shift);


# store model results
m4_earnPOCintxn_coefs = fixef(model4_earnings_potc_intxn)
earnCoef_2 = m4_earnPOCintxn_coefs[1] 
pocCoef = m4_earnPOCintxn_coefs[2];
pocEarnCoef = m4_earnPOCintxn_coefs[4]
pocTrialCoef = m4_earnPOCintxn_coefs[5]

# PSH did a thing to figure out what the effect of past outcome is given the difference between expectations (trial) and how someone is doing (earnings). Since they are both scaled 0 to 1, you can do the following:
# past outcome beta + (earnings x otc beta * pick an earning value) + (trial x otc beta * pick a beta value)

# earlier in the task:
# pocCoef + pocEarnCoef*.2 + pocTrialCoef*.3 = -1.027033   # doing worse than expected 
# pocCoef + pocEarnCoef*.3 + pocTrialCoef*.3 =  -0.238776  # doing as expected 
# pocCoef + pocEarnCoef*.4 + pocTrialCoef*.3 =  0.5494805  # doing better than expected

# middle of the task
# pocCoef + pocEarnCoef*.5 + pocTrialCoef*.6 = -0.5019535  # doing worse than expected 
# pocCoef + pocEarnCoef*.6 + pocTrialCoef*.6 =  0.2863031  # doing as expected 
# pocCoef + pocEarnCoef*.7 + pocTrialCoef*.6 =  1.07456    # doing better than expected

# late in the task:
# pocCoef + pocEarnCoef*.7 + pocTrialCoef*.8 = -0.1519007  # doing worse than expected 
# pocCoef + pocEarnCoef*.8 + pocTrialCoef*.8 = 0.6363558   # doing as expected 
# pocCoef + pocEarnCoef*.9 + pocTrialCoef*.8 =  1.424612   # doing better than expected

# Overall, when participants did worse than expected, they took less risks and when earnings are more than expected, they took more risks and this pattern is stronger following a large outcome relative to a small outcome. It is possible that past outcome is the vehicle for the interactio between earnings and outcome, and trial and outcome. Likely a discussion for the supplement as a possible "why" for the interaction between two timescales.

# Plot interaction between outcome and earnings

poc= rep(c(0,.5,1), times =3)
earnings = rep(c(.0, .5, 1), each =3)

### Each timescale in a single model:
#### Summary: Similar effects that we have noted prior: negative past outcome effect that interacts with cumulative earnings and positive shift effect. 
```{r}
model5_potc_posshift_earn_trial = glmer(choice ~ 0 + poc1scaled*earningsNormalized + shiftDiffscPOS + trialSC + (1|subjectIndex), data=mriBehClean, family="binomial", offset=pred)

summary(model5_potc_posshift_earn_trial); # everything significant, AIC = 7553.0 
```

##### Plot earnings x outcome effect using the model above (the interaction term is much smaller than in m4_earning_potc_intxn model), so we'd expect the switching of the past outcome effect to be less intense:
```{r}

```{r} 
# In the figure above showing risk taking as a function of earnings and trial because they have opposite effects. Could it be that these effects are capturing the overall difference between actual earnings and expected earnings (which could be captured by a linear regressor like trial)? This could imply that people are adjusting their risky choice behavior depending on how they are doing compared to how they EXPECT to be doing. If that is the case, then points above p(Gamble) = .5 implies that when people do better than expected, there is more risk-seeking and points below p(Gamble) = .5 implies that when people are doing worse than expected, there is less risk-seeking.

# Our task includes small --> large shifts up and down which could add to how people may expect to be doing (are they adjusting their expectations differently across the levels of context)? One way to account for this is by a 'level-tracking' variable (just adding up level on each trial, which will be a very similar variable to cumulative earnings). This variable is scaled between 0 and 1 for each participant (normalized within participant)


# Run some regressions adding level-tracking and compare to our model above with trial, earnings, poc*earnings, positive shift (AIC = 7553.0).


# trial, level tracking, earnings, poc, positive shift, earnings*poc.

The beta estimates for trial and level tracking are similar but opposite direction and the interaction between poc and level tracking estimate/p value are similar to cumulatve earnings and poc scaled in previous model. Is level tracking and cumulative earnings too similar?

summary(model4_expectedEarn_noTrial); # AIC = 7560.5 - this has larger AIC than our original model (AIC = 7553.0)


# The best model includes trial and cumulative earnings (not level tracking). This seems like expectations are not changing level-wise. It looks like people are not significantly adjusting their expectations (in Khaw (2017) people are adjusting after hundreds of trials). If it is the case that people are not adjusting their expectations, are they not adjusting their reference point?

```


A few things seem to be happening: (model5_potc_posshift_earn_trial). 
# 1) There is a negative past outcome effect
# 2) There is a shift effect
# 3) There is a sign that there is something happening at the third level but the effect is happening across several regressors (earnings, trial, earnings x outcome, and possibly trial x outcome). It is not a nicely itemized effect like shift and past outcome effects and this effect could be happening as a result of the first level (past outcome). While it seems like one thing is happening, previous outcome effect changes based on how you're doing relative to expectations but it is so spread out across the variables that it makes the model with everything in it (the model including trial * poc) challenging. We could create a variable that captures the difference between earnings and expected earnings but the issue here is that we have to estimate the weighting - we try this at the end of this section:

# The interaction between past outcome and trial is trending p=.1. Past outcome, shift, and interaction between past outcome and earnings still there. Now the main effect of earnings and trial not there.

# Can we create a variable that makes this model more interpretable??? What about a relative earnings variable that captures the difference between earnings and trial? The thing here is that we still have to add trial or earnings because the relative earnings variable gives earnings and trial the same weight and adding one of those variables to the model lets us figure out the weighting.

# What this model means: negative past outcome effect (cool - expected), positive shift effect (also cool - expected), interaction between relative earnings and past outcome, and interaction bewteen trial and past outcome



# plotting relative earnings x outcome interaction - ONLY SHOWING ONE PART OF THE PICTURE HERE THO - but the effect is that there is a negative efffect of past outcome that gets weaker/flips slightly as participants do better in the task (when earnings are much more than expected).
