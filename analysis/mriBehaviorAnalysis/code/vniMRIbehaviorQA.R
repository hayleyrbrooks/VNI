# Quality analysis for VNI MRI behavior dataset
# (e.g. how many missed trials? how many missed attention checks? individual-level glm)

# output:
# 1) behQualCheck.Rdata - for each sub, total and proportion of "no mans land" choices, total and proportion of choices where safe = 0 and partiicipants took the gamble
# 2) subID_exclude.Rdata - which participants are we excluding (1 = exclude; 0 = keep)
# 3) subChoices.pdf - each participant's choices over the task and as a function of safe x risky gain, pgamble included

# Notes: updated 11/11
# all subs (except 16) show individual models that reflect they were paying attention
# sub 016 -> estimates are right valence-wise but betas are not significant - this person only took 4 gambles the entire time (pgam = .02) - lots of motion in functional data
#sub 006 missed 4/16 (25%) attention check choices
#sub 021,  031 missed 1/13 (.07%) attention check choices
#sub 026 missed 1/15 nml choices
#sub 042 missed 49 trials, pgamble = .85
#sub 043 had a pgamble of .009 and did not have significant betas for gains and loss in glm, and played it safe on one trial where they should have gambled.
